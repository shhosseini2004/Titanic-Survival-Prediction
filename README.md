## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains a complete **Machine Learning project** focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using historical data. The core analysis and model training are performed within the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure
The structure is designed for clarity and reproducibility:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Environment:** JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Key Analysis Steps
The notebook walks through the following essential data science workflow:

1.  **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loading `train.csv` and understanding initial data types and missing values.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key features (Sex, Pclass, Age, Fare) against the survival target to gain insights.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data (imputation) and encoding categorical features.
4.  **Model Building:** Training and tuning classification models to achieve the best prediction accuracy.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

## 🎯 How to Run Locally
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
